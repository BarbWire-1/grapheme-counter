## Approach
The grapheme-counter library provides functionality for accurately counting grapheme clusters in strings, taking into account combined emoji sequences and diacritical marks. This approach ensures precise counting even in cases where traditional methods might yield incorrect results.

# Key Components
Grapheme Cluster Detection
The core functionality of the library revolves around detecting and isolating individual grapheme clusters within a given string. This is achieved through the use of Unicode regular expressions, which are capable of correctly identifying grapheme boundaries.

# Combined Emoji Sequences
One of the key challenges in grapheme counting arises from combined emoji sequences, where multiple Unicode characters are combined to form a single emoji. The library handles such sequences appropriately, ensuring that each combined emoji is counted as a single grapheme cluster.

# Diacritical Marks
Another aspect addressed by the library is the handling of diacritical marks, which can modify the appearance or pronunciation of a character. By accounting for diacritical marks, the library ensures accurate grapheme counting in languages that use such characters extensively.

## Implementation Details
The library utilizes regular expressions and Unicode properties to identify and count grapheme clusters. It handles complex scenarios such as combined emoji sequences and diacritical marks by employing comprehensive pattern matching techniques.

## Edge Cases
While Grapheme Counter aims to cover a broad range of scenarios, there may still be edge cases or specific language nuances that require attention. These edge cases could include rare character combinations, unconventional usage patterns, or scenarios not yet considered.
